Despite of technology, let us compare once with a blind persons. How they are managing everyday. If we are blind, just imagine 
yourself, which is very miserable than any of your conflicts. This is quiet interesting aspect for the project.

In electronics,  in this arena everything is possible with the coding tactics and electronics stuff.  Here comes up with an 
idea.  Which is particularly a robot which is fixed with the IR sensor.  Which is used to detect the obstacle through heat
and motion of the object.  If the robot is walking forward in front there is an obstacle, then it will take turn as your 
program like right or left. Either backward or stop.  Choose accordingly your project requirements.
